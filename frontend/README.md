# ChessCompetitionPlanner
This application was built for Schaakclub Dordrecht, to manage the youth competition.
The idea is that on club evenings we can have a check-in of players, after which the round schedule is generated. Results are immediately processed.
All should work on a mobile phone.
It uses Angular 6.0 and ngrx/store. 
The app is going to store data in a database through a CRUD REST API.

At the moment this is work in progress. Not ready for use. Feel free to use this code.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
